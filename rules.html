        <h2>2026 Season Rules</h2>
        <h3>Points</h3>
        <p>Over the course of the season, players earn points for their wins on league day each month.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Players win 3 points per match win and 1 point per draw.</li>
            <li>The first tiebreaker for league standings is each player's total 3-0 records, followed by 2-0-1 records, and continuing down until the tie is broken. If there is still a tie for a top 8 spot by the end of the league, the players will organise a one round play-off before the top 8 event.</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3>Schedule and qualifying events</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All players who attend at least one league match are registered in the league.</li>
            <li>League match events are listed on the Schedule page and will occur on the last Sunday of each month.</li>
            <li>The league has 10 scoring matches, with a player's worst 5 weeks dropped from scoring.</li>
            <li>The schedule may be adjusted at any time to account for holidays and store availability. Adjustments will be posted to the Schedule page.</li>
        </ul>    
        <h3>Top 8</h3>
        <p>The top 8 participents in the league will play a final single elimination top 8. This will occur on the second saturday in November, or the Saturday before nationals, whichever is earlier.</p>
        <h3>Prizes</h3>
        <p>Traditionally the main prize for the UK leagues has been a bye at nationals.</p>
        <p>When nationals is confirmed, this will become the main prize for the winner.</p>
        <p>Additional prizing is not guaranteed, but anyone is free to donate.</p>
