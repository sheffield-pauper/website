        <h2>2026 Season Rules</h2>
        <h3>Points</h3>
        <p>Over the course of the season, players earn points for their wins on league day each month.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Players win 3 points per match win and 1 point per draw.</li>
            <li>The first tiebreaker for league standings is each player's total 3-0 records, followed by 2-0-1 records, and continuing down until the tie is broken. If there is still a tie for a top 8 spot by the end of the league, the players will organise a one round play-off before the top 8 event.</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3>Schedule and qualifying events</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All players who attend at least one league day will be automatically registered in the league.</li>
            <li>League day events are listed on the Schedule page and will occur on the last Sunday of the months January to October, as well as 4 additional scoring days on the second Wednesday of July to October </li>
            <li>The league has 14 scoring days, only a players top 7 scoring days will count towards their total score. For example, if you play 8 days and score 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 points, only days with scores of 2-8 would count (the 1 point day would be dropped).</li>
            <li>The schedule may be adjusted at any time to account for holidays and store availability. Adjustments will be updated on the Schedule page and the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sheffield_pauper_league/">Instagram page</a>.</li>
        </ul>    
        <h3>Top 8</h3>
        <p>The top 8 finishers by the end the league will play a final single elimination top 8 event. This will occur on the second saturday in November, or the Saturday before nationals, whichever is earlier.</p>
        <h3>Prizes</h3>
        <p>The main prize for the winner of the top 8 is a bye at this years pauper nationals event, details for this event are generally released mid-year and the event normally takes place in November.</p>
        <p>Any additional donated prizing will be distributed as the donator wishes (in 2025, this was a couple of chase rares).</p>
